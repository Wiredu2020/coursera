      <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
      <p>A mixture of pounded cassava and boiled plantains, essential to Ghanaian cuisine. It is typically a lunch/dinner preparation and is often made from scratch. Part of the evening villagescapes have women and helpers, sitting outside with few words – most of the sounds are produced by the heaving, lifting and dropping of a flat-bottomed pestle<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Beef</p>
      <p>This is a simple, uncooked sauce made of ground tomatoes, onions and fresh green scotch bonnets. In Nigeria, it forms the base of our ‘stews’. In Ghana, it is served at lunch or dinner with Banku, and grilled Tilapia. I was sceptical till I tried it! Wow, I couldn’t stop eating it. It is meant to be served ‘raw’ and only lightly seasoned with some salt. It was hard for me to believe that a blend of ingredients which I normally cook to smithereens could yield a different sort of deliciousness served in the ‘nude’.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

      <p class="item-name">Sushi</p>
      <p>Every street corner has a coconut cart, where able bodied men wielding machetes are happy to slice off the head of a young coconut so one can drink of its youth-giving waters. Once you’re done, they are also happy to break the nut open and  make a scoop with which you can consume the young flesh. According to our tour guide, if a hospital runs out of saline waters for ‘drips’, the waters from a carefully opened coconut can be used to restore life and vitality to the ill man..<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
